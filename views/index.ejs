            <h2>It's FREE to play Rugby Super 6!</h2>
            <p>First you must register to play Super 6. All you need to do is click and complete your details to register.</p>
            <p>Simply predict the correct scores for our six selected matches for your chance to win £250,000 (unless otherwise specified)!</p>
            <p>To make your predictions you will need to login at the top of this page.</p>
            <p>Super 6 games will be chosen from the rounds of the Rugby World Cup! You must submit your predictions the day before the kick off of the first game of the round.</p>

            <h2>Scoring system</h2>
            <p>You now get 2 points for correctly predicting the result of a Game.</p>
            <p>
                The Golden Try tiebreaker is used to determine the winner of the guaranteed weekly, monthly and season competitions,
                but only as a way of separating the people who have the same total points, same amount of correct scores and the same amount of correct results.
            </p>

            <p>You get a maximum of 5 points for each match (2 points for a correct result or 5 points for a correct
            score). In the event of two or more players having the same number of points, the Golden Try will come
            into play as part of the tie breaker process.</p>
            <p>Don't forget, if you correctly predict all 6 matches in one week you could net yourself our jackpot of £250,000 (unless otherwise specified)!</p>
