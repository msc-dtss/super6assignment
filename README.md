# Super 6 Rugby
This is for the First Assignment for the 2019 MSc for Digital &amp; Technology Solutions Specialist.

## Why Rugby?
The day we started brainstorming our plan together, it was the start of the 2019 Rugby World Cup, so why not?

## Game Format
See [Game Format](docs/game_format.md)

## Technical Documentation
* [User Interface Views](docs/ui_views.md)
* [Module Breakdown](docs/code_modules.md)

## Get Started
Ensure MongoDB is running on your system on the default port, the app will attempt to connect to the 'super6db' database on this server.


On a terminal (cmd), follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository from github
  * `git clone https://github.com/msc-dtss/super6assignment.git`
2. Navigate into the folder
  * `cd super6assignment`
3. Install the npm packages
  * `npm install`
4. Run the express app with nodemon
  * `nodemon bin/www`
5. The app should now be available on http://localhost:3000
6. Use the git commands when you make changes (Visual Studio Code has a nice gui for this out of the box)
   * `git pull` - pull the latest changes from github
   * `git add FILE` - add a file or file changes to the stage
   * `git commit -m 'MESSAGE'` - commit the staged changes with a descriptive message
   * `git push` - push the committed changes back to github
