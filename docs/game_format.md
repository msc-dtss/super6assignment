# World Cup Super 6 (Rugby Union) - Group Project
* The Rugby Union World Cup Super 6 (the game) will be played for each round of pool games (20th September - 13th October)
* 6 games will be selected at random from each round
* Each group has 5 teams therefore a round is 2.5 fixtures * 4 groups = 10 fixtures
* Because of scheduling one round has 11 and one round has 9 fixtures, this has no effect on the game
* A team could appear more than once but this would have no effect on the game
* The rounds are determined as follows (fixtures here - https://www.rugbyworldcup.com/matches)
    * 20th Sept - 25th Sept (10 fixtures)
    * 26th Sept - 2nd October (10 fixtures)
    * 3rd October - 8th Oct (9 fixtures)
    * 9th Oct - 13th Oct (11 fixtures)
* Each user has the ability to predict the following elements of the result for each of the 6 fixtures
    * The number of tries for each side
    * The winner of the game (this could be different to the team with the most tries)
* Each user can also choose a Golden Try time, this is the time of the first try in any of the six fixtures
* Until kick-off in the first fixture the predictions can be altered
* Points are scored for correct predictions
    * 2 points for a correct result
    * 5 points for a correct number of trys
    * 7 points maximum (because team with most trys may not win the game)
* The winner (if any) of the £250,000 jackpot prize is the user who has correctly predicted the trys in all 6 games
* In the event of more than one user qualifying for the jackpot, the user with the closest Golden Try prediction is the winner
* In the event of more than one user finishing equal on Golden Try and all six scores the prize will be split equally
* In addition to the jackpot there is a weekly £5,000 consolation prize awarded to the user with the greatest number of points for the 6 fixtures
* In the event of more than one user having the highest score the winner will be the user with the closest Golden Try prediction
* In the event of more than one user having matching score and Golden Try predictions the £5,000 prize will be split equally
* There is an additional bonus prize of £1,000 awarded to the weekly winner if they correctly predict 5 of the 6 results
* If a user doesn't win, they should TRY harder :-)
